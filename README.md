# MakeChange

This is a cash register program where the user attempts to pay for an item. Test conditions are:
Amount: .67, Tendered: .50, Result: Error message
Amount: .67, Tendered: 1.00, Result: 1 quarter, 1 nickel, 3 pennies.
Amount: .59, Tendered: 1.00, Result: 1 quarter, 1 dime, 1 nickel, 1 penny.
Amount: 3.96, Tendered: 20.00, Result: 1 ten dollar bill, 1 five dollar bill, 1 one dollar bill, 4 pennies.

I wanted to challenge myself this weekend so I wrote the assignment twice. MakeChange2 uses the modulo operator and MakeChange3 uses arrays to arrive at a similar result.
